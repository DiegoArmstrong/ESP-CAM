# ESP-CAM

# Project Overview
This repository showcases the development of a live video streaming web server using the ESP32-CAM module. The project demonstrates the successful implementation of a system that enables real-time video streaming from the ESP32-CAM to a web browser.

#Project Description
The focus of this project was to leverage the capabilities of the ESP32-CAM module to create a web-based live video streaming application. By utilizing the ESP32-CAM's integrated camera module, I developed a system that captures video frames and streams them in real-time to a web browser.

The project involved configuring the ESP32-CAM, establishing a local web server, and implementing the necessary functionalities for video capturing, encoding, and streaming. Through this implementation, users can access a web interface and view the live video stream from the ESP32-CAM.
